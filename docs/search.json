This course introduces students to key concepts in causal inference, statistical methodologies, and their applications in spatial analysis. Throughout the quarter, students will engage with various statistical techniques, including randomized control trials (RCT), matching, synthetic controls, differences-in-differences (DID), instrumental variables, regression discontinuity design, and machine learning (ML).\nCourse Objectives\nThe course will involve a series of readings, assignments, and practical applications to deepen the understanding of causal analysis in geography. Students will learn to:\nUnderstand the potential outcomes framework for causal inference.\nUtilize causal diagrams to represent relationships in spatial data.\nDesign and implement RCT and power calculations for spatial data.\nApply matching and synthetic control methods to estimate causal effects.\nUse DID and instrumental variables in spatial statistics.\nIncorporate ML and remote sensing in causal analysis for geographical studies.\nCourse Goals\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\nInterpret and conduct causal analyses in spatial data.\nImplement various statistical methods for causal inference in geographical research.\nApply statistical tools and methodologies to real-world spatial problems.\nDevelop skills in presenting and discussing statistical findings related to causal analysis.\nCritically assess and apply different causal inference methods to geographic data.\n\n\n\n",
